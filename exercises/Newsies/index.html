    <h1><span style="color: steelblue;">MONOLITH PRESS</span></h1>
    <h2><span style="color: maroon;">A 100-Car Army of Sound in Los Angeles</span></h2>
    <p>“A (for 100 Cars)” was, by turns, a placid deliberation, a thunderous roar, an ambitious lark.
      A public sound art installation made possible through corporate largess —
      the performance was part of the first Los Angeles edition of the Red Bull Music Academy festival -
      it turned negative space in the center of downtown Los Angeles into a sublime womb.
      All around, tall buildings loomed, while on the performance stage, 100 cars worked through what felt like a meditation.</p>

      <p><span style = "font-weight: bold";>Mr. Ikeda’s composition juxtaposed precision and imprecision:</span> 440Hz is the current tuning standard for A, but that wasn’t always the case.
        Each car here was paired with a historical tuning, with frequencies ranging from 376.3Hz to 506.9Hz.
        Also, though this composition could have been performed cleanly by computer, it instead relied on amateur performers —
        the drivers, who in many cases were the creative and technical architects of their cars,
        but in this case were also the musicians.
        Each had a pocket-size synthesizer programmed to one specific frequency and a dedicated score instructing him or her how to manipulate
        the knobs at various points in the 27-minute piece.</p>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold";>The influential photographer Estevan Oriol was in the front row with his lovingly-detailed 1964 Chevrolet Impala SS lowrider.</span>
          “I’m trying to expand our car culture,” he said. “The lowrider community for the most part only do lowrider community-related stuff.
          I never even heard of anything like this.”</p>
